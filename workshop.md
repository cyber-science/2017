## (1) The 2nd International Workshop on Emerging Dependable Computing System Technologies and Applications (EDCSTA 2017)

### Scope and topics

Advances in computing systems and innovative technologies are fast growing towards developments of more complex, heterogeneous and dynamically scalable
computing systems. However, these systems are still vulnerable to system failures or any other untoward incidents. The cloud computing system, as an abstraction
of  concealed  complex  infrastructure  of  virtualized  resources  to  provide  cloud  services,  has  spurred  the  grand  challenges  in  computing.  The  EDCSTA-2017  is  to
provide a venue of scientific interaction of grand challenging research areas and developments of emerging dependable infrastructure/platforms of complex network
computing system technologies, innovations, and applications.  

Topics include, but are not limited to the following:  

1. Cloud Computing Systems/Applications/Services
2. Cloud and IoT Convergence
3. Resilient Cloud
4. Ontologies in Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
5. Mobile Pervasive Computing
6. Reliability and Fault-tolerance
7. Dependability in Cloud Computing Systems

### Workshop Organizers:

- Bernady O. Apduhan , Kyushu Sangyo University, Japan
- Tadashi Dohi, Hiroshima University, Japan

### Paper Submission Guidelines:  

The submitted papers must be 6 pages long including figures and references, and prepared according to IEEE Computer Society CPS format (two columns, single-spaced, 10 fonts). Check the Author Guidelines through this link: http://www.computer.org/web/cs-cps/. Submitted papers will be peer reviewed by at least two reviewers. The materials presented in the papers should not be published or under submission elsewhere. Submission of a paper implies that should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors should register and orally present the paper in the conference.

All papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format through the DASC 2017 submission system: [https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=23118](https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=23118) Accepted papers will be included in the DASC-2017 conference proceedings to be published by IEEE-CS CPS (indexed by EI).

## (2) IEEE CyberSciTech 2017 Workshop on Social Networks and Intelligence in Cyberspace (SNIC-2017)

### Scope and topics

The emergence of social networking services are serving as an important resource for social interactions and communications in cyber space. Furthermore, current social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedin, provide new opportunities and social intelligence to explore user behavior which could benefit various applications related to economy, marketing, education, business, medicine, etc.
SNIC-2017 aims to discuss the theories and methodologies from different disciplines such as computer science, artificial intelligence, data mining, machine learning, ubiquitous computing, social network analysis, cyber science, computational journalism, network science, sociology, data science, and statistics in order to provide conceptual insights on extracting social intelligence.
We invite researchers and practitioners from aforementioned communities to share their ideas, innovations, research achievements and solutions in fostering the advancement of intelligent data analytics and management of social networking data from cyber space.

Topics:

1. Fundamentals of social computing
2. Statistical modeling of large networks
3. Community discovery and analysis in large-scale social networks
4. Large-scale graph algorithms for social network analysis
5. Reputation, trust, privacy and security in social networks
6. Expert systems and decision-making for social media data
7. Recommendation systems and marketing
8. Methods for tie strength or link prediction
9. Methods for extracting and understanding user and group behavior
10. Social intelligence aware applications
11. Crowdsourcing and collective intelligence
12. Other issues related to various social computing applications and case studies

### Submission:

Authors are invited to submit their original work (4~6 pages length) by IEEE Computer Society formats. Please select the SNIC-2017 special session when you upload your paper through EDAS https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=23118

### Organizers:

- Fei Hao, Shaanxi Normal University, China (fhao@snnu.edu.cn)
- Muhammad Atif Qureshi, Insight-Centre (UCD), Ireland
