## (1) IEEE CyberSciTech 2017 Workshop on Social Networks and Intelligence in Cyberspace (SNIC-2017)

### Scope and topics

The emergence of social networking services are serving as an important resource for social interactions and communications in cyber space. Furthermore, current social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedin, provide new opportunities and social intelligence to explore user behavior which could benefit various applications related to economy, marketing, education, business, medicine, etc. 
SNIC-2017 aims to discuss the theories and methodologies from different disciplines such as computer science, artificial intelligence, data mining, machine learning, ubiquitous computing, social network analysis, cyber science, computational journalism, network science, sociology, data science, and statistics in order to provide conceptual insights on extracting social intelligence.
We invite researchers and practitioners from aforementioned communities to share their ideas, innovations, research achievements and solutions in fostering the advancement of intelligent data analytics and management of social networking data from cyber space. 

Topics:

- (1) Fundamentals of social computing
- (2) Statistical modeling of large networks
- (3) Community discovery and analysis in large-scale social networks
- (4) Large-scale graph algorithms for social network analysis
- (5) Reputation, trust, privacy and security in social networks
- (6) Expert systems and decision-making for social media data
- (7) Recommendation systems and marketing
- (8) Methods for tie strength or link prediction
- (9) Methods for extracting and understanding user and group behavior
- (10) Social intelligence aware applications
