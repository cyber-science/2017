## Title

Human Activity and Emotion Tracking with Microsoft Kinect and Wearable Devices

## Abstract

This tutorial covers emerging topics on how to use Microsoft Kinect and commercial-off-the-shelf wearable devices such as Smart Watches and Microsoft Band for innovative human-centered cyber-physical systems. This tutorial will contain the following topics: (1) Human motion tracking with Microsoft Kinect; (2) Gesture and activity recognition algorithms, including both rule-based and machine-learning based approaches; (3) Activity and sleep tracking using inertial sensors; (4) Physiological sensing using Smart Watches and Microsoft Band, such as heart rate, heart rate variation, skin conductance level, etc.; (5) Applications of Microsoft Kinect and wearable devices; (6) Human-computer interactions, including natural user interfaces, context-aware sensing, and haptic feedback; (7) Open research issues. This tutorial will enable participants to understand cutting-edge depth sensing and wearable computing technologies, learn various algorithms for human activity recognition, and learn how to build human-centered cyber-physical systems with real-time sensing, decision making, and feedback. 

## Short Bio

Dr. Zhao is a full Professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Cleveland State University. He earned his Ph.D. at University of California, Santa Barbara in 2002. Dr. Zhao has been doing research on smart and connected health since 2010. He has an active sponsored research grant on building a Kinect-based system to enhance safe patient handling in nursing homes, and has taught several sections of a course on Kinect application development at Cleveland State University. Dr. Zhao has over 150 peer-reviewed publications, and a US patent (pending) on privacy-aware human activity tracking. He has served on several NSF panels for the smart and connected health, and the smart and autonomous systems programs. He served as the Program Chair for IEEE Smart World Congress (Toulouse, France) in 2016. Dr. Zhao is a member of the IEEE SMC TC on Cybermatics for Cyber-enabled Worlds.
