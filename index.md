### Theme: Towards Cyber-Enabled New Sciences, Technologies and Applications for a Better Society

The modern digitized world has led to the emergence of a new paradigm on global information networks and infrastructures known as Cyberspace and the studies of Cybernetics, which bring seamless integration of physical, social and mental spaces. Cyberspace is becoming an integral part of our daily life from learning and entertainment to business and cultural activities. As expected, this whole concept of Cybernetics brings new challenges that need to be tackled.

To address these emerging challenges, there is a need to establish new science and research portfolios that incorporate cyber-physical, cyber-social and cyber-mental technologies together in a coherent manner to deliver the vision of Cyberspace. This is the aim of the 2017 IEEE Cyber Science and Technology Congress (CyberSciTech 2017) to offer a common platform for scientists, researchers and engineers to share their latest ideas and to exchange the latest developments and outcomes in their research and technologies, with a broad scope of cyber-related science, technology and application topics. CyberSciTech 2017 covers four main research tracks including but not limited the following areas or topics.
