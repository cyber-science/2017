## (1) Virtual Reality under Cyber

### Scope and topics

In the past several years, we have seen dramatic advancement in many applications enabled by the use of virtual reality technologies. The purpose of this special issue on CyberSciTech 2017 is to offer a platform for scientist and researchers to exchange their novel ideas and outcomes in research and technology on virtual reality. The main topics of interest are on challenges and innovations for virtual reality and its applications in game, movie and social networking. We are seeking papers in, but not limited to, the following main areas: 

- (1) Architecture and equipment for virtual reality 
- (2) Facial animation, human motion analysis and synthesis
- (3) Fluid animation and fluid modeling 
- (4) Computer vision for 3D modeling
- (5) Augmented reality and image processing for visual effects

## (2) Cyber-Enabled Smart Environment and Healthcare (Cyber-ESEH)

### Scope and topics

In this special session, we are interested in research on cyber-enabled systems, technologies, and applications related to smart environment and healthcare. Smart home technologies have been starting to reach millions of consumers. Such technologies promise to make our life much easier and enjoyable. There are many exciting open research opportunities, such as context-aware sensing and decision making, intention recognition based on body languages as well as oral commands, realtime monitoring and intervention for home-based care for patients with autism, ADHD, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia.  This line of research has a unique characteristic in that the target physical elements are predominantly human beings. Various sensors could be used to monitor the state of a person, which could be the vital signs or the quality and quantity of designated activities performed by the person. The technology developed for cyber-enabled smart environment and healthcare should be capable of detecting key events, establish behavioral patterns, communicating with cloud services for additional information if needed, and understand the situation, which would lead to appropriate feedback or intervention, either to the patient themselves directly, or to healthcare professionals.  

Topic of interests of this special session include, but not limited to:

- (1) Smart and connected health
- (2) Smart home 
- (3) Internet of Things
- (4) Wearable sensing and computing
- (5) Speech recognition and speaker identification
- (6) Computer vision and image processing
- (7) Behavior analysis and modeling of human activities
- (8) Context-aware sensing and decision making 
- (9) Human-cyber-physical interaction
- (10) Sensing, networking, and computing with smart phones and wearable devices
