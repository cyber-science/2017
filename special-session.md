## (2) Cyber-Enabled Smart Environment and Healthcare (Cyber-ESEH)

### Scope and topics

In this special session, we are interested in research on cyber-enabled systems, technologies, and applications related to smart environment and healthcare. Smart home technologies have been starting to reach millions of consumers. Such technologies promise to make our life much easier and enjoyable. There are many exciting open research opportunities, such as context-aware sensing and decision making, intention recognition based on body languages as well as oral commands, realtime monitoring and intervention for home-based care for patients with autism, ADHD, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia.  This line of research has a unique characteristic in that the target physical elements are predominantly human beings. Various sensors could be used to monitor the state of a person, which could be the vital signs or the quality and quantity of designated activities performed by the person. The technology developed for cyber-enabled smart environment and healthcare should be capable of detecting key events, establish behavioral patterns, communicating with cloud services for additional information if needed, and understand the situation, which would lead to appropriate feedback or intervention, either to the patient themselves directly, or to healthcare professionals.
